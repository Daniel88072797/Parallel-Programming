## Parallel-Programming

###  Homework 1: Odd-Even Sort
get familiar with MPI by implementing a parallel odd-even sort algorithm. 
###  Homework 2: Mandelbrot Set
parallelize the sequential Mandelbrot Set
program, and learn the following skills:  
● Get familiar with thread programming using Pthread and OpenMP.  
● Combine process and thread to implement a hybrid parallelism solution .  
● Understand the importance of load balance.
###  Homework 3: All-Pairs Shortest Path
solve the all-pairs shortest path problem with CPU
threads and then further accelerate the program with CUDA accompanied by Blocked
Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
###  Homework 4: MapReduce
practice the parallel programming
skills by implementing the scheduling and parallel programming model of the well-known
big data processing framework, MapReduce.
### Final project
Accelerated PSO by parallelizing the computation of each particle on the GPU using CUDA.
